    <h1>Chapter 12: Models of Computation</h1>
    <h1>What is the purpose of a model</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The purpose of a model is to simpliffy complex systems into a more manageable theoretical framework that can be analyzed and studied ussing mathematical or logical tools.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>List four phenomena of a model:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Abstraction: Models are abstractions of real-world systems or processes that simplify and distill them down to their essential features or behaviors.</li>
        <li>Simplification: Models are typically simpler than the systems they represent, often leaving out non-essential details or factors that are not relevant to the analysis or study at hand.</li>
        <li>Approximation: Models are usually approximations of the real-world, as they cannot capture every aspect or detail of a system perfectly. However, a good model should be accurate enough to provide useful insights or predictions.</li>
        <li>Validation: Models must be validated by comparing their predictions or results to real-world data or observations to ensure that they are accurate and useful. This often involves adjusting or refining the model based on feedback from the validation process.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>List four Things a computing agent should do:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Input and Output: A computing agent should be able to take in data or information from the outside world (input), process it, and produce output in a form that is useful to humans or other machines.</li>
        <li>Computation: A computing agent should be able to perform computations or operations on data, such as mathematical calculations, data transformations, or logical operations.</li>
        <li>Storage and Retrieval: A computing agent should be able to store and retrieve data or information, either in memory or in some external storage medium, such as a hard drive or a database.</li>
        <li>Communication: A computing agent should be able to communicate with other agents, either locally or over a network, to exchange data, information, or messages. This often involves using protocols or standards for encoding and transmitting information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>What is the "halting problem" with reagard to an uncomputable problem?</h1>
    <h1>Chapther 13: Simulation & Modeling</h1>
    <h1>Define these terms</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Scientific Method: The scientific method is a systematic approach used by scientists to investigate and understand the natural world. It involves a series of steps, including observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation, data analysis, and conclusion drawing. The scientific method is designed to ensure that the results of an investigation are accurate, reliable, and replicable. </li>
        <li>Computational Model: A computational model is an abstract representation of a system or process that can be simulated or analyzed using a computer. It is used to study the behavior of complex systems that are difficult or impossible to observe directly. A computational model can be used to make predictions about the behavior of a system under different conditions, or to optimize the performance of a system..</li>
        <li>Discrete Event Simulation: Discrete event simulation is a type of simulation that models the behavior of a system by simulating individual events that occur over time. It is often used to model complex systems in which events occur in a stochastic or random manner. In a discrete event simulation, the simulation clock jumps from one event to the next, rather than proceeding continuously. This allows the simulation to model the behavior of the system more accurately and efficiently. Discrete event simulation is widely used in many fields, including engineering, computer science, and operations research.</li>
        <li>
            List and describe seven reasons to construct a simulation model:
            <ul>To understand a system: A simulation model can be used to gain a better understanding of a system, how it works, and how its various components interact with each other.</ul>
            <ul>To predict the behavior of a system: A simulation model can be used to make predictions about how a system will behave under different conditions or scenarios.</ul>
            <ul>To evaluate different strategies: A simulation model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies or policies, and to identify the best course of action.</ul>
            <ul>To optimize system performance: A simulation model can be used to optimize the performance of a system by identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.</ul>
            <ul>To reduce risk: A simulation model can be used to test the performance of a system in a safe and controlled environment, reducing the risk of failure or disruption in the real world.</ul>
            <ul>To reduce costs: A simulation model can be used to test and refine designs, processes, and systems, reducing the costs associated with trial and error.</ul>
            <ul>To train personnel: A simulation model can be used to train personnel in how to operate and manage a system, without the risks or costs associated with real-world training.</ul>

    <h1>Illustris: "The Mother of All Computations"</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What is Illlustris? Illustris is a large cosmological simulation project that models the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe using supercomputers. It is designed to provide insights into the physical processes that shape galaxies and to test theories about the universe.</li>
        <li>What  fields of science were involved in the Illustris computational model? The fields of science involved in the Illustris computational model include astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, computer science, data analysis, and visualization. The model simulates the physical processes that shape galaxy formation and required collaboration among experts from various fields to achieve its goals.</li>
        <li>What does Illustris simulate?Illustris simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe, starting from shortly after the Big Bang and continuing to the present day. The simulation models the interactions between dark matter, gas, stars, and black holes, and includes a wide range of physical processes such as gravity, hydrodynamics, star formation, and feedback from supernovae and black holes. The goal of Illustris is to provide a comprehensive and realistic model of galaxy formation that can be used to test theories and make predictions about the universe.</li>
        <li>How long did the project take?The Illustris project took several years to plan, develop, and execute. While the exact timeline may vary depending on the specific aspects of the project, the initial planning and development of the simulation took place in 2009, and the simulations themselves were run on supercomputers for several months to generate the data. The first results from the Illustris simulation were published in 2014, so it can be said that the project took at least several years to complete.</li>
        <li>How many years of gallactic evolution are simulated in Illustris? The Illustris simulation models the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe from about 12 million years after the Big Bang to the present day, which is approximately 13.8 billion years later. This means that the simulation spans a time period of around 13.8 billion years - 12 million years = 13.79 billion years, which represents a significant portion of the history of the universe.</li>
        <li>Illustris was created using two supercomputers. What is a supercomputer? (Do a Google search) A supercomputer is a high-performance computer designed to perform complex calculations and simulations quickly. It has multiple processors, large amounts of memory and storage, and specialized hardware to accelerate certain types of calculations. The Hazel Hen and Kraken supercomputers were used to run the Illustris simulation, allowing researchers to model the formation and evolution of galaxies with great accuracy and detail.</li>
