    <h1>Chapter 8: Information Seccurity</h1>
    <h1>Student: Justin D'Ambola</h1>
    <h1>Briefly describe or define:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Information security: The practice of protecting sensitive or valuable information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</li>
        <li>Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system component, usually by providing credentials such as a username and password or biometric data.</li>
        <li>Authorization: The process of determining what actions or resources a user, device, or system component is allowed to access, based on their authenticated identity and assigned permissions.</li>
        <li>Dual authentication (also known as two-factor authentication): A security mechanism that requires users to provide two different types of credentials in order to access a system or resource, typically a password or PIN and a physical token or biometric identifier.</li>
        <li>Social engineering: The use of psychological manipulation or deception to trick individuals into divulging confidential information, performing actions, or making decisions that benefit an attacker.</li>
        <li>Virus: A type of malicious software (malware) that spreads by infecting other files or systems, typically by attaching itself to executable code or exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Worm: A type of malware that replicates itself across a network or the internet, often without requiring user interaction, and can cause damage or disruption by consuming network bandwidth or overwhelming systems.</li>
        <li>Trojan horse (or Trojan): A type of malware that masquerades as a legitimate program or file, but contains hidden malicious code that can be used to steal data, take control of a system, or perform other unwanted actions.</li>
        <li>Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts files or entire systems, and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key.</li>
        <li>Phishing: A type of social engineering attack that uses email, text messages, or other communication methods to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
        <li>White hat: A term used to describe ethical hackers or security researchers who use their skills to identify vulnerabilities and improve security, typically with the permission of the target organization.</li>
        <li>Black hat: A term used to describe malicious hackers or attackers who use their skills to exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm or steal information for personal gain.</li>
        <li>Encryption/decryption: The process of encoding or scrambling data so that it cannot be read or understood without a key or password, and then decoding or unscrambling the data using the same key or password.</li>
        <li>Cryptography: The study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (i.e., eavesdroppers or attackers), including encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.</li>
        <li>Symmetric encryption algorithm: A type of encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.</li>
        <li>Caesar cipher: A simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions (e.g., three), wrapping around from Z to A.</li>
        <li>Block cipher: A type of encryption algorithm that divides the input data into fixed-size blocks and encrypts each block separately.</li>
        <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES): A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 56-bit key to encrypt 64-bit blocks of data.</li>
        <li>Public key system: A type of encryption system that uses two different keys (a public key and a private key) for encryption and decryption, allowing for secure communication without the need for a shared secret.</li>
        <li>Embedded computers: Small, specialized computer systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, often with limited processing power and memory, and are integrated into other devices or systems. Examples include microcontrollers in appliances, sensors in industrial equipment, and control systems in vehicles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Briefly describe how a test file can be hidden in a steganographic image: </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Steganography is the practice of hiding information within a seemingly innocuous object or file, such as an image, audio file, or text document. To hide a test file within a steganographic image, one approach is to use a technique called "LSB (least significant bit) steganography." This involves replacing the least significant bits of the pixels in the image with the bits of the test file, effectively "hiding" the file within the image.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1> List six ways to protect yourself from most cyber attacks (see page 486) </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Use strong and unique passwords: Use a different password for every account, and make sure each password is at least 12 characters long, with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
        <li>Keep your software up to date: Make sure all your devices and applications are running the latest versions, which often include security patches and bug fixes.</li>
        <li>Use antivirus and anti-malware software: Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on all your devices, and keep it updated with the latest definitions and security patches.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication: Use two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible, which requires users to provide two forms of authentication (such as a password and a code sent to a mobile device) in order to access an account or system.</li>
        <li>Be cautious with email and attachments: Don't open suspicious emails or attachments, and don't click on links from unknown or untrusted sources.</li>
        <li>Backup your data regularly: Make sure to regularly backup your important files and data to a secure location, either in the cloud or on an external hard drive, in case of a cyber attack or other data loss event.</li>
    </ol>
