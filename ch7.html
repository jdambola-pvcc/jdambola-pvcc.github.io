    <h1>Chapter 7: Computer Networks & Cloud Computing</h1>
    <h1>Student: Justin D'Ambola</h1>
    <h1>Briefly describe or define:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Computer network: A computer network is a group of computers or devices that are connected together to share information and resources.</li>
        <li>Analog device: An analog device is a device that processes or represents information using continuous signals that vary in amplitude, frequency or phase.
            <ul>An example of an analog device would be a vinyl record player. Vinyl record players work by reading grooves in a record with a needle, which vibrates with the sound waves recorded in the groove.</ul></li>
        <li>Digital device: A digital device is a device that processes or represents information using discrete signals that have two states, such as on or off.
            <ul>An example of a digital device is a computer. They use digital components like transistors, capacitors, and microprocessors to perform operations like arithmetic, logic, and storage.</ul></li>
        <li>Modem: A modem is a device that allows computers to communicate with each other over a telephone or cable line by converting digital signals into analog signals and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Bandwidth: Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time, usually measured in bits per second (bps).</li>
        <li>Ethernet: Ethernet is a wired networking technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a local area network (LAN).</li>
        <li>WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network, a wireless networking technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a local area network using radio waves.</li>
        <li>IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard: This is a set of standards for wireless LANs that defines the physical and data link layers of the network protocol.</li>
        <li>MAN: MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network, a network that covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, usually within a city or town.</li>
        <li>Internet of Things: The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.</li>
        <li>LAN: LAN stands for Local Area Network, a network that connects computers and other devices within a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building.</li>
        <li>Repeater: A repeater is a device that amplifies and retransmits signals over a network to extend its range.</li>
        <li>Bridge: A bridge is a device that connects two or more LANs or network segments and filters and forwards data between them.</li>
        <li>WAN: WAN stands for Wide Area Network, a network that covers a large geographical area, such as a city, country, or even the world.</li>
        <li>Packet and packet switching: A packet is a unit of data that is transmitted over a network. Packet switching is a networking technology that breaks data into small packets and sends them over a network using the most efficient route available.</li>
        <li>ISP: ISP stands for Internet Service Provider, a company that provides internet access to customers.</li>
        <li>Firewall: A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules.</li>
        <li>Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over a network.</li>
        <li>Cloud computing: Cloud computing is a model of computing that allows users to access and use shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, over the internet.</li>
        <li>Net neutrality: Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination or preferential treatment given to certain types of traffic or content.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP(the Internet protocol hierarchy): </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Application layer: This is the layer closest to the end-user and is responsible for providing access to network services and applications, such as email, web browsing, and file sharing.</li>
        <li>Transport layer: This layer is responsible for ensuring reliable communication between applications running on different devices. It breaks down data into smaller packets, assigns sequence numbers to them, and manages the flow of data between devices.</li>
        <li>Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing packets between different networks. It determines the most efficient path for data transmission and handles addressing and packet forwarding.</li>
        <li>Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data over a physical network link. It breaks down packets into frames and manages the flow of data between devices.</li>
        <li>Physical layer: This is the lowest layer in the TCP/IP hierarchy and is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural specifications for transmitting data over physical media, such as copper wires, fiber optic cables, or wireless signals.</li>

    </ol>
    <h1>List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits: </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>File sharing: File sharing is a network service that allows users to share files and folders between devices connected to the same network. This service offers several benefits, such as:</li>
        <li>Email: Email is a network service that allows users to send and receive electronic messages over the internet. This service offers several benefits, such as:</li>
        <li>Print sharing: Print sharing is a network service that allows users to share printers between devices connected to the same network. This service offers several benefits, such as:</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Chapter 7 IEEE questions.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What does the acronym, IEEE stand for? The acronym IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</li>
        <li>What is the mission and vision of IEEE? The mission of IEEE is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. </li>

    </ol>
    <h1>The 3 Different LAN Topologies</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bus Topology: In a bus topology, all devices on the network are connected to a single communication line called the "bus." Each device receives all transmissions, but only the intended recipient processes the message. This topology is relatively simple to install and requires less cabling than other topologies. However, it can be difficult to troubleshoot if the bus line fails, and the performance of the network may suffer as more devices are added.</li> 
        <li>Ring Topology: In a ring topology, all devices on the network are connected in a closed loop, with each device connected to the next. Messages are transmitted around the ring until they reach their intended recipient. This topology is reliable and easy to manage, as each device only communicates with the device on either side of it. However, it can be difficult to add new devices to the network, as the entire ring must be taken down to add or remove a device. Additionally, if one device or cable fails, the entire network may be affected.</li>
        <li>Star Topology: In a star topology, all devices on the network are connected to a central hub or switch. Each device communicates with the hub or switch, which then forwards the message to the intended recipient. This topology is easy to install and maintain, and failures in one device or cable do not affect the rest of the network. However, it can be expensive to implement because each device requires its own cable to connect to the hub or switch.</li>
