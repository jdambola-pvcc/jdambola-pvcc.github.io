    <h1>Chapter 1: An Introduction to Computer Science</h1>
    <h1>Student: Justin D'Ambola</h1>
    <h1>Three misconceptions about Computer Science:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer Science is only for people that are good at math.</li>
        <li>Computer Science is only people who studied Computer Science in a 4year school.</li>
        <li>Computer Science is only sitting infront of a computer all day typing code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Computer Science Definitions in Chapter 1</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer Science: The study of algorithms.</li>
        <li>algorithm:A well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations that, when executed, produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time</li>
        <li>Sequential operation:Algorithmic structure that carries out a single task and then moves on to the next operation in sequence</li>
        <li>Conditional operation:Algorithmic operation that asks a question and selects the next step to carry out based on the answer to that question</li>
        <li>iterative operation:Algorithmic operation that repeats a block of instructions</li>
        <li>Stored program computer:A model of computation in which the instructions to be executed are represented as binary string and stored in the memory of the computer</li>
        <li>Programmer: Someone who uses high-level landuages to solve problems by creating computer programs</li>
        <li>Integrated circuit: A discrete electronic components, integrated circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitor etched onto a piece of silicon</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>The 5 generations of computer development</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>1st Generation 1950-1957: This era saw the appearance of UNIVAC I, the first computer built for sale, and the IBM 701, the first computer built by the company that would soon become a leader in this new field.</li>
        <li>2nd Generation 1957-1965: Heralded a major change in the size and complexity of computers. In the late 1950s, the bulky vacuum tube was replaced by a single transistor only a few millimeters in size, and memory was now constructed using tiny magnetic cores only 1/50th of an inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>3rd Generation 1965-1975: This was the era of the integrated circuit. Rather than using discrete electronic components, integrated circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitors were photographically etched onto a piece of silicon, which further reduced the size and cost of computers.</li>
        <li>4th Generation 1975-1985:  The appearance of the first microcomputer. Integrated circuit technology had advanced to the point that a complete computer system could be contained on a single circuit board that you could hold in your hand.</li>
        <li>5th Generation 1985-present:  Where we are today. However, so much is changing so fast that the concept of distinct generations of computer development has outlived its usefulness.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>FORTRAN</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>FORTRAN stands for Formula Translation</li>
        <li>FORTRAN was developed in 1957 by John Backus.</li>
        <li>FORTRAN was designed as the first standard computer language and dominated the field of computer science for many years</li>
        <li>FORTRAN is still in use in many scientific fields such as doppler radar wearther forecasts.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>COBOL</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language</li>
        <li>COBOL was developed in 1959 to allow programs from different computer manufactures to run with little modifications and to have a language that can be read in ordinary english. </li>
        <li>COBOL was used for people in the finance industry and human resources.</li>
        <li>COBOL is still used today in many industries and is still in demand</li>
    </ol>
