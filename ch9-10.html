    <h1>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h1>
    <h1>List four disadvantages of using assembly Languages</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>1. It takes a lot of time and effort wot write the code</li>
        <li>2. It is very complex and difficult to understand.</li>
        <li>3. The syntax is difficult to remember.</li>
        <li>4. It has a lack of portability of programs between different computer architectures.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>List four expectations programmers have for wiriting programs in a high level language ("third generaton" language):</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Object-oriented programming (OOP): The ability to define classes that encapsulate data and methods, which make it easier to model real-world entities and their behavior.</li>
        <li>2. Data abstraction: The ability to hide irrelevant details from the user, making it easier to write and maintain code.</li>
        <li>3. Automatic memory management: The ability to allocate and deallocate memory automatically, freeing the programmer from concerns about manual memory management.</li>
        <li>4. Strong type checking: The ability to catch type errors at compile time, rather than at runtime, which improves the overall quality of the program.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Briefly descrbe or define</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>object code: Machine-readable code generated by a compiler from the source code of a computer program.</li>
        <li>source code: Human-readable code written by a programmer in a programming language.</li>
        <li>procedural language: A programming language that uses a programming syntax that specifies a sequence of instructions that the computer can execute.</li>
        <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A software application that provides tools for software development, such as source code editing, debugging, and testing.</li>
        <li>Software development life cycle (SDLC): A series of stages that software development teams use to develop and maintain software.</li>
        <li>Waterfall model of software development: A linear software development methodology that divides the development process into distinct phases, with each stage completed before the next phase begins.</li>
        <li>Agile model of software development: A software development methodology that focuses on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions are developed in short sprints.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Describe each of these components of the software development life cycle:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Feasibility study: An assessment of whether a project is practical and financially viable before it begins.</li>
        <li>Problem specification: Defining the problem a software system is meant to solve, including user requirements and constraints.</li>
        <li>Program design: Creating a plan or blueprint for a software solution, including functionality, user interface, and system interactions.</li>
        <li>Algorithm selection: Choosing the most suitable algorithm to solve a specific problem based on its efficiency, accuracy, and suitability.</li>
        <li>Coding: Writing software code using a programming language based on the program design and algorithms.</li>
        <li>Debugging: Finding and fixing errors or bugs in software code to ensure proper functionality.</li>
        <li>Testing: Testing the software in various scenarios to ensure it meets user requirements and specifications.</li>
        <li>Verification: The process of ensuring that the software meets all requirements and specifications and performs as expected.</li>
        <li>Documentation: Creating written or visual materials that describe the software system, including user manuals, technical documentation, and system architecture diagrams.</li>

    <h1>Questions & Answers</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Q: Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</li>
        <li>A: The Tower of Babel story is referenced regarding computer languages because it describes a situation where people spoke different languages, causing confusion and hindering their ability to communicate and work together. Similarly, there are many programming languages that can cause confusion and difficulty in communication between programmers. </li>
        <li>Q: Why isn't there just one computer programing language?</li>
        <li>A: There isn't just one programming language because different languages are suited to different tasks and have different strengths and weaknesses. Also, different programmers may have different preferences or be more familiar with certain languages.</li>
        <li>Q: Why didn't FORTRAN use the less thean ( < ) symbol when comparing two numbers?</li>
        <li>A: FORTRAN used the .LT. symbol instead of < for comparing two numbers because < was already being used for input/output operations in the language. </li>
        <li>Q: What was COBOL designed for?</li>
        <li>A: COBOL was designed for business applications, particularly for handling large amounts of data. </li>
        <li>Q: What was the language, C, designed for?</li>
        <li>A: The language C was designed to write operating systems, but it has since been used for many other purposes, including application development. </li>
        <li>Q: What is the difference between C and C++?</li>
        <li>A: C++ is an extension of C that includes features for object-oriented programming. </li>
        <li>Q: Who or what is the language, Ada named for and why?</li>
        <li>A: The language Ada was named for Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician who is credited with writing the first computer program. </li>
        <li>Q: What is a Java "applet"?</li>
        <li>A: A Java "applet" is a small program that runs within a web browser. </li>
        <li>Q: How much does Python cost to download, install and use?</li>
        <li>A: Python is free to download, install, and use. </li>
        <li>Q: What is Microsoft.NET?</li>
        <li>A: Microsoft.NET is a framework for building Windows-based software applications. </li>
        <li>Q: What is SQL and what is it used for?</li>
        <li>A: SQL is a programming language used for managing and querying databases. </li>
        <li>Q: What is R and what is it used for?</li>
        <li>A: R is a programming language and software environment used for statistical analysis and data visualization. </li>
        <li>Q: What is Go (or golang) and what is it used for?</li>
        <li>A: Go, or golang, is a programming language designed for building efficient, reliable, and scalable software systems. </li>
        <li>Q: What is Swift and what is it used for?</li>
        <li>A: Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for developing applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. </li>
   </ol>


    <h1>Briefly describe each of the following alternative programming paradigms</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and avoids shared state and mutable data. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values. The goal of functional programming is to create code that is easy to reason about and has few side effects.</li>
        <li>Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is based on formal logic. In logic programming, programs are written in terms of logical statements or rules, and the program's execution involves the derivation of logical conclusions based on these rules. This allows programmers to express problems in a declarative way, rather than specifying a step-by-step algorithm for solving them.</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is a programming paradigm that is designed to take advantage of parallel computing architectures, where multiple processors or cores can execute instructions simultaneously. Parallel programming involves dividing a problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved concurrently, and then combining the results to produce a final solution. This can lead to significant performance improvements over sequential programming on single-core machines.</li>
