                        <li>Q. What is a version control system</li>
                        <li>A. version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to source code and other files. It keeps track of changes made to a codebase over time, enabling developers to view and revert to previous versions of a file or project.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Q. What is Git?</li>
                        <li>A. Git is a distributed version control system used for managing source code changes in software development projects.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub</li>
                        <li>A. Git is a software tool that allows developers to manage source code changes in software development projects, while GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides additional tools for collaboration and project management. While Git can be used independently of GitHub, GitHub relies on Git for version control.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Q. Who started GitHub and how was it started?</li>
                        <li>A. GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett. The idea for GitHub arose from their experience with developing open-source software and collaborating with other developers around the world.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Q. How much does a GitHub account cost?</li>
                        <li>A. For public accouts GitHub is free but GitHub offers a range of pricing plans, including both free and paid options. The cost of a GitHub account depends on the features and services that are included in the plan.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Q. What is the octocat?</li>
                        <li>A. The Octocat is the official mascot of GitHub. It is a cartoon cat with eight tentacles, a reference to the octopus, which represents the versatility and flexibility of Git and GitHub.</li>

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>repository: A repository, or "repo" for short, is a collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git. It can be thought of as a project folder that contains all the source code, documentation, and other files related to a software project.</li>
                    <li>commit: A commit is a record of changes to the files in a repository. It represents a snapshot of the files at a particular point in time and includes a message describing the changes made.</li>
                    <li>fork: Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository on GitHub. This allows users to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository, and to submit their changes as pull requests for review.</li>
                    <li>push: Pushing is the process of uploading local changes to a remote repository, such as a repository on GitHub. This makes the changes available to other contributors and allows for collaboration on the code.</li>
                    <li>pull request: A pull request is a proposal for changes to a repository. It is typically created by a user who has forked the repository and made changes to the code, and it allows the owner of the original repository to review and accept or reject the changes.</li>
                    <li>workflows: Workflows are a set of automated actions that can be triggered by specific events in a GitHub repository. Workflows can be used to automate tasks such as building and testing code, deploying applications, and sending notifications. </li>
                    <li>issues: Issues are a way to track and manage bugs, feature requests, and other tasks in a GitHub repository. They allow users to report problems, suggest improvements, and assign tasks to specific contributors.</li>
                    <li>raw button: The raw button is a button on a GitHub repository that allows users to view the raw content of a file. This can be useful for viewing code without the formatting and syntax highlighting that is added by default in the GitHub interface.</li>
                    <li>blame button: The blame button is a button on a GitHub repository that allows users to see who last edited each line of a file. This can be useful for tracking down bugs or understanding why certain changes were made to the code.</li>
