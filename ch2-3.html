    <h1>Chapter 2 Algorithms</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain why natural language is not an effective tool for describing algorithms</li>
        <p>Natural language is not an effective tool for describing algorithms because of its ambiguity, lack of structure, difficulty of parsing, limited expressiveness, and lack of standardization. Instead, specialized programming languages and pseudocode are used to accurately and unambiguously describe algorithms.</p>
        <li>
            Problem: 1
            <p>A studnet has three grades: The final grade is the average of the three. List the algorithmic steps to find the final grade</p>
            <ol>
                <li>input first grade</li>
                <li>input second grade</li>
                <li>input third grade</li>
                <li>add the three grades</li>
                <li>divide by the number of grades</li>
                <li>output the average of the grades</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Problem: 2
            <p>A car owner recorked the car's previous car mileage, current mileage, and the number of gallons of gas the owner filled their tank with. List the algorithmic steps to find the car's mpg (miles per gallon)..</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Input the previous car mileage.</li>
                <li>Input the current car mileage.</li>
                <li>Input the number of gallons of gas the owner filled the tank with.</li>
                <li>Subtract the previous mileage from the current mileage to find the number of miles driven.</li>
                <li>Divide the number of miles driven by the number of gallons of gas to find the car's miles per gallon (MPG).</li>
                <li>Output the car's MPG.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Chapter 2 Definitions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Natural Language: Natural Language refers to the way humans communicate with each other using spoken or written language. It is the language that is used by humans to communicate with each other in their daily lives.</li>
        <li>Pseudocode: Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of an algorithm that uses a mixture of natural language and programming language-like syntax. It is used as a tool for planning and communication in the development of software and other systems. </li>
        <li>sequential operation (straight-line algorithm):  A sequential operation or straight-line algorithm refers to a type of algorithm in which the instructions are executed in a linear sequence, one after the other. This means that the output of one operation is used as the input for the next operation.</li>
        <li>Input: Input refers to the data that is fed into a system, algorithm, or program to be processed or analyzed.</li>
        <li>Output: Output refers to the result of a system, algorithm, or program after it has processed or analyzed the input data.</li>
        <li>Conditional statement: A conditional statement is a programming construct that allows for the execution of different sets of instructions depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.</li>
        <li>Boolean condition: A Boolean condition is a statement that evaluates to either true or false. It is used in conditional statements to determine whether a certain set of instructions should be executed. </li>
        <li>Algorithmic discovery process: The algorithmic discovery process refers to the process of developing an algorithm or refining an existing algorithm through a combination of experimentation, analysis, and iteration. This process involves testing and refining the algorithm until it produces the desired result.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Chapter 3 Definitions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Why algorithms should be correct: Algorithms should be correct because they are used to solve problems, and an incorrect algorithm can lead to incorrect or unpredictable results. A correct algorithm ensures that the problem is solved in a predictable and reliable manner.</li>
        <li>Why algorithms should be efficcient: Algorithms should be efficient because they are often used to solve large or complex problems, and an inefficient algorithm can take an unreasonable amount of time to solve the problem. An efficient algorithm ensures that the problem is solved in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
        <li>Program maintenance: Program maintenance refers to the process of updating and modifying a program after it has been deployed. This is necessary to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features.</li>
        <li>Importance of algoritim ease of understanding:  The ease of understanding an algorithm is important because it allows developers to quickly and accurately implement the algorithm, reducing the chance of errors or inefficiencies.</li>
        <li>Algorithmic elegance: Algorithmic elegance refers to the quality of an algorithm that is both efficient and easy to understand. An elegant algorithm is a balance between efficiency and simplicity. </li>
        <li>Sequential search algorithm: A sequential search algorithm is a simple algorithm that searches through a list or array one item at a time until it finds the item it is looking for. </li>
        <li>Order of magnitude: Order of magnitude is a measure of the size or scale of a value, typically represented as a power of 10. </li>
        <li>Selection sort: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted part of the list and moving it to the beginning of the sorted part of the list. </li>
        <li>Flop (floating point operation): A flop, or floating point operation, is a mathematical operation that involves floating point numbers. It is often used as a measure of computer performance. </li>
        <li>Terraflop:  A terraflop is a measure of computer performance that represents one trillion floating point operations per second.  </li>
        <li>Petaflop:  A petaflop is a measure of computer performance that represents one quadrillion floating point operations per second.</li>
        <li>Parallel processor: A parallel processor is a type of computer architecture that uses multiple processors to perform calculations simultaneously, increasing the overall speed and efficiency of the system. </li>
        <li>Data cleanup porblem: The data cleanup problem refers to the challenge of cleaning and preparing large datasets for analysis. This often involves removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing the format of the data. </li>
        <li>Binary search algorithm: A binary search algorithm is a more efficient algorithm for searching through a sorted list or array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.</li>
        <li>Pattern matching: Pattern matching refers to the process of finding a specific pattern or sequence of characters within a larger string or data set. It is often used in data analysis and text processing. </li>
